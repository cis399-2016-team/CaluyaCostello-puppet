<h1> Pidgin Help Page </h1>
<p> If you would like to use pidgen to use our XMPP service, start by downloading pidgin at <a href=https://www.pidgin.im/> this website. </a> 
<br>
Once Pidgin is installed open Pidgin.exe. Then on the accounts screen click "add account". This will open an "add account" box. Under the "basic" tab, select protocol XMPP for the drop down menu. Then, for the "username" field, use your AWS login. This is case sensitive, so if you used any caps in your AWS login use them again here. For the "domain" field select either of these puppet instances: ec2-52-39-165-25.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com or ec2-52-41-63-84.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com . Both instances host a server so it doesn't matter which you select. However, if you have a particular classmate you would like to chat with make sure you both use the same server, as users aren't able to chat across servers. Next move to the "password" field, your initial password will be "cis399". If you want to change this password contact the admins at costello@uoregon.edu or elicaluya@yahoo.com</p>
<br>
<p>
Next, move click the advanced tab. In the advanced tab the first field is "Connection secutity". This field has a drop down menu. Make sure "Require encryption" is selected in this drop down menu. This helps ensure the security of your conversations and our users. Next, on the "Connect port" field, enter "5222". This value may already be filled in for you, but ensure that is the port entered. Finally, in the "connect server" field, enter the same instance domain you entered in the "basic" tab under the "domain" field. Now you are done. Click the "add" button at the bottom of the box and your account will have been added to Pidgin. </p>
<br>
<p> Once the account has been added to Pidgin, a "buddy list" should launch. Now you're almost ready to chat. To add homies, select the "Buddies" tab in the top left corner of the buddy list. Then select add buddies. To add a buddy, under the "account" field, enter your friends aws login @ the instance domain you selected earlier. For example, "costello@ec2-52-41-63-84.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com" if you wanted to add me. Replace "costello" with the AWS username you wish to add and replace "ec2-52-41-63-84.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com" with whichever instance domain you are using. Next click the add button. Once your friend accepts your invitation you are ready to chat! </p>
